# distributed-library
This project involves the development and deployment of a book rental application for local libraries in Belgrade, Novi Sad, and Ni≈°, along with a central library system. Each local library application allows librarians to register new members, manage book rentals, and returns. Key functionalities include member registration with central library database verification, book rental processes considering maximum limits, and return management. The project embraces containerization using Docker Compose and deployment on a Minikube local Kubernetes cluster.
